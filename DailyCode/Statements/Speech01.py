Peace is nothing more than a pause between battles.
Every generation fights for its own definition of freedom.
Laws are written by those who hold authority,
and broken by those desperate enough to resist it.
Right and wrong shift like shadows,
depending on where the light falls.
And when the smoke clears,
only the winners decide what was righteous.
