Heroes and villains are decided by the stories people choose to believe.
In times of chaos, truth is buried beneath victory.
The strong call their actions justice,
while the weak call the same acts cruelty.
Power reshapes morality,
and history remembers only the side that survives.
In the end, the world kneels not to justice,
but to the will of the victor.
